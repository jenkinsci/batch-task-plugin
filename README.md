Batch Task Plugin
=====================

The Batch Task Jenkins plugin adds batch tasks to [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) jobs. Batch tasks are useful for tasks that are not regularly executed, such as releases, integration, archiving, etc. In this way, anyone in the project team can execute them in a way that leaves a record.
